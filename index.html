      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an avid programmer/designer who just wants to make the world a better place!
        <br> <br>
        I've been programming since i was 9 at <a href="https://tinkercademy.com/">Tinkercad Academy</a>. <br>
        Ever since then, my passion to join The School of Science and Technology grew, and that's where i currently am! <br>
        Ive joined SST Inc., Computing, made business website templates, drew a bunch of art and much more projects!
        <br> <br>
        Ever since My math tuition teacher reccomended programming, ive been interested in making projects that people can use and wow at,
        and that little passion inspired my dream to make something that will make the world better!

          <h3>Geometry Dash Art</h3>
          <p> Ever since i was 5, i was attracted to this game called Geometry Dash.
            I wasnt sure why, but i played it for ages, and i found the level editor where users are able to build 
            levels, using simple shapes like squares and lines. This idea got me attracted, and the technicality behind me kept 
            me building for years, so here is a bit of <a href="https://ko-fi.com/album/art-L3L01ARFFF">My Art!</a></p>

          <h3>Programming Projects & Competitions</h3>
          <p>I've made quite a number of projects ever since I was 9 such as a new Programming Language <a href ="">(SingmaLang)</a>, 
            business website templates <a href="">(Trombone E-Commerece Site)</a>, and (fill) . I've also participated in competitions, such as <a href="">(fill)CTF</a> and Hackathons!
             The first hackathon i had went for was when i was 10 years old!
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, this website was fully coded by me! Ive had a passion for HTML and CSS for a pretty long duration and coding websites for fun was a big hobby of mine!

          <h3>Outside of Computing and Design</h3>
          <p>You see - I was the type of guy that couldn't stick to one thing for a long period of time. That peaked my interest to try out other things, and so i joined various
            competitions, hobbies, and so much more. Thats why i started learning various things, being the gituar, keyboard, graphic design, game design, rollerblading, joined <a href="https://www.syfc.sg/">SYFC</a>,
